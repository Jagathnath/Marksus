# Marksus
Deciphers shift cipher.
You needn't know the shift, just enter the cipher and you are good to go. 

There's also a simple encrypter, cuz why not. 

For decrypting textfiles, if some error pops up, make sure the file is in the Marksus Directory or the you enter absolute path of the file. The decrypted result of the input file will be saved to output.txt file by default.
